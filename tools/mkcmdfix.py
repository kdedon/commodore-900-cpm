"""mkcmdfix.py - the synthetic .CMD fixtures `make i86test' loads.

    mkcmdfix.py <destdir>

src/shim/tests/i86corpus/ holds four of DRI's own .CMD files, and they answer "does
the loader read what a real file says".  They cannot answer anything else:
all four are small-model, all four carry A-Base 0, and none of them is
malformed.  So the header space the loader must refuse -- kill criterion K1
(CPM86-STAGE-ONE.md §6) and every CE_* error in src/shim/i86.h -- has no real
file behind it, and never will.  These fixtures are that half, built from
the format description in src/shim/i86load.c: a 128-byte header of eight
9-byte group descriptors (G-Form, G-Length, A-Base, G-Min, G-Max, all
little-endian paragraph counts) followed by the group images in descriptor
order.

Four of them also RUN.  The real files cannot: their first BDOS call has
nowhere to go until the INT 0E0h seam exists, so nothing here is a copy of
one.  They are the smallest programs that make a loader decision visible in
a result -- the 8080 model's entry at code offset 0x100, G-Max 0 resolving
to a whole segment through the base page the guest itself reads, and the
difference
between "we do not implement this" and "this is not an instruction", which
is the property that keeps future widening honest.

One fixture is not a .CMD at all.  GENCMD.CMD reads FILENAME.H86 and
writes FILENAME.CMD, and no corpus of .CMD files can supply its input, so
<destdir>/I86HEX.H86 is built here too -- real DRI hex, real checksums,
around a hand-assembled 8086 program.  See p_hex().  I86T.A86 is ASM86's
input, the same program's shape in source form.  See p_asm().

Output is <destdir>/*.CMD plus <destdir>/I86HEX.H86, I86T.A86 plus
<destdir>/MANIFEST, which is what src/shim/tests/i86test.c reads:

    LOAD <file> <CE_*> [model=|entry=|ng=|alloc=n,n|need=]
    RUN  <file> <X_*>  [ip=|ax=|bx=|cx=|dx=|sp=|steps=|w=seg:off:val]

Every expected value in the manifest is written here from the fixture's
intent -- the sum a program computes, the allocation rule stated in
i86load.c's galloc() -- and never read back out of the loader or the
executor, which would agree with themselves and prove nothing.

    real declares an extra, a stack or an auxiliary group and the compact
    and large paths of src/shim/i86load.c i86place() have no corpus behind
    them.  This is that corpus: five groups -- code, data, extra, stack and
    aux 1 -- built here from the format description, which is why nothing
    binary is shipped for it.

    IT DOES NOT TAKE THE LOADER'S WORD FOR ANY OF IT.  Every claim
    i86place() makes is checked from inside the guest, by a program that
    can only pass if the claim holds:

      1. ES is a DIFFERENT segment from DS.  It writes 0xBEEF at ES:0x300,
         then 0xCAFE at DS:0x300, then reads ES:0x300 back.  One segment
         behind both -- which is what the loader did before the extra
         group had a segment of its own -- gives 0xCAFE and fails here.
      2. SS is a different segment again.  It pushes the marker and reads
         it back through an explicit SS: override at the address the push
         must have used.
      3. The auxiliary group has a segment and NO segment register, so the
         only way to it is the base page: the program loads its paragraph
         from DS:0x1b -- the base word of the fifth six-byte group-table
         entry, which i86bpage() fills from g->par -- into ES, and writes
         and reads through it.
         i86resolve() has to answer that paragraph without a slow-path
         escape, which is what makes `slow segment resolutions 0' on the
         target a statement about this program.

    Then it prints and exits through the BDOS, so the same file is a target
    gate (tests/verify.mk verify-i86) and not only a host fixture.  The
    manifest entry stops at the FIRST INT, where DX names which of the two

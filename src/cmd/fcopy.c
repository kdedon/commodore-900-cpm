/*
 * fcopy.c - copy a file record-by-record through the BDOS sequential
 * file calls: open/make/delete/read/write/close plus SETDMA, all via
 * the SC #2 shim.  Usage:  FCOPY SRC.TYP DST.TYP
 *
 * The copy is built in a scratch file of type $$$ and only put in the
 * destination's place once it has been written, closed, and the close
 * CHECKED.  Deleting the destination first -- which this did -- threw a
 * good file away before knowing a replacement could be produced: a full
 * disk, a refused directory write or an exhausted directory then left the
 * user with a partial file, or none at all, where a whole one had been.

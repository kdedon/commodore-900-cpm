 * gdpbpack -- our drive as the seventeen bytes a CP/M guest expects:
 * SPT, BSH, BLM, EXM, DSM, DRM, AL0, AL1, CKS, OFF, PSH, PHM, words low
 * byte first because both guests are little-endian machines and the
 * Z8001 this runs on is not.  A CP/M 2.2 guest reads the first fifteen
 * and stops, which is why there is one block here and not two.
 *
 * Three of the twelve fields need a decision; the rest pass through.
 *
 * AL0 and AL1 are one word here (dir_al), and its bits run from block 0
 * downwards from the top, so the byte order is the word's HIGH byte
 * first.  Our 0xF000 is the four directory blocks src/bios/bios900.c
 * reserves, and the same four seldsk() computes from DRM and BLM when it
 * logs a drive in (src/bdos/fileio.c).
 *
 * PSH and PHM describe the physical sector the BDOS would have to
 * deblock to, and ours are zero because there is nothing above the BIOS
 * to deblock: its read and write entries take one 128-byte record
 * (src/bios/bios900.c), and the 512-byte blocks underneath them are its
 * own affair and never reach a DPB.
 *
 * CKS passes through at our BIOS's zero -- a fixed disk whose directory
 * is never checksummed -- rather than being invented as DRM/4.

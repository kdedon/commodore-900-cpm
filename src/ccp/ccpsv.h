/* CCP state preserved across transient reloads.
 *
 * It holds every value that must survive __LOAD: program-launch data,
 * chained-command and SUBMIT state, CCP.CFG state, and pointers into its own
 * buffers. Scratch parse and DMA buffers remain in transient BSS because each
 * CCP invocation initializes them before use.
 *
 * THIS IS RESIDENT PER-PROCESS STORAGE, NOT A PAGE IN THE TPA.  It used to
 * sit at a fixed TPA offset of 0xFA00, which made it the first thing standing
 * in the way of a TPA segment shorter than 64 KB, and left it within reach of
 * a program that ran past @MXTPA.  The system now keeps one per process
 * descriptor (src/bdos/proc.c), the transient CCP keeps a working copy in its
 * own BSS, and the two are exchanged by the two BDOS calls below.  Nothing in
 * the TPA is reserved for it any more, so the RSX ceiling is the top of the
 * segment (src/bdos/rsx.c) and every program gets those 1,536 bytes back.
 *
 * The exchange is per process by construction: both calls act on the
 * descriptor of the process that makes them, so two sessions never share one.

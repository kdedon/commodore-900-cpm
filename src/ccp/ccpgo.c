*		The CCP's half of the program load			*
*									*
*	When the CCP was resident, `go.c' did the whole job: it built	*
*	the Load Parameter Block, called BDOS function 59, filled the	*
*	base page and jumped into the program with `xfer'.  Half of	*
*	that is CCP work and half of it is system work, and a		*
*	transient CCP can only do the first half:			*
*									*
*	  - the two base-page FCBs come from parsing the command tail,	*
*	    which only the CCP can do (`fill_fcb' reads `parm', `index'	*
*	    and `nd_argu', all of them CCP parse state);		*
*	  - the transfer of control is an IRET in SYSTEM mode		*
*	    (`src/glue.s' `xfer_': it writes NSPSEG/NSPOFF and resets	*
*	    the system stack).  A program in the TPA runs in Normal	*
*	    mode and cannot do it.					*
*									*
*	So the CCP leaves a request in the state page and warm boots.	*
*	`sys/ccprun.c' picks the request up on the way back and does	*
*	the second half.  CP/M 3 needs no such split because its CCP	*
*	and its programs share one address space and one privilege	*
*	level: `ccp3.asm' calls the LOADER RSX and then jumps to 100h	*
*	itself.								*
*									*
*	This is also why the request carries the FCBs and not the	*
*	command: the system does not parse command lines, the CCP	*
*	does, and function 47 (chain to program, `bdosmain.c:629')	*
*	already exists for the other direction -- a PROGRAM handing a	*
*	command line back to the CCP.					*

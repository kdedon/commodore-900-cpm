/*  A OUTLIVES B, and the count had to grow when the tick started
    preempting.  Six was enough while the only switch point was a
    BDOS call: A and B alternated line for line, so B's three lines and
    its 4 KB self-check were done by A's second or third.  Under
    preemption B does that 4 KB WHILE A prints -- the machine is shared
    by time rather than by call, so B's silent work no longer waits for
    A to stop asking for the console -- and at six lines A finished
    first, which is the one thing this program must not do: the claim
    "once B ended, A ran alone" needs an A that is still there.  Twelve
    is that with margin, and it is not a timing constant in any sharper
    sense than six was.  */
